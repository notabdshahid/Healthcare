# Healthcare AI - Predicting Disease from Symptoms
This project is a machine learning-based healthcare solution that predicts potential diseases based on user-input symptoms. The app is powered by various AI techniques, including data analysis, machine learning models, and symptom association inference.
## Features
Disease Prediction: Predict diseases based on the symptoms input by users.
End-to-End Streamlit App: User-friendly web app using Streamlit to input symptoms and see disease predictions in real time.
## Technologies Used
Python 3.12+
Streamlit: For building the interactive web application.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and model building.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Matplotlib: For visualizations and plotting.
Joblib: For saving and loading machine learning models.
## How to Run the Application
Launch the Streamlit Web App: Once you've installed the dependencies, you can run the app using the following command: 
streamlit run app.py
